Hi, there, and welcome! I'm Yifei, an undergraduate at Cornell, studying fantastic mathematics and computer science. I have been working in the area of Natural Language Processing and Theoretical Reinforcement Learning, fortunate enough to have been working with [prof. Yansong Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/ysfeng/home) at Peking University, [prof. Wen Sun](https://wensun.github.io/) at Cornell University, and [Dr. Sernam Lim](https://sites.google.com/site/sernam) at Meta AI. 

My work touches on Natural Languae Processing, Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning Theory. My research interest lies in building principled and generalizable deep learning methods, and doing so requires a guaranteed machine learning approach and insight from human cognition. I'm recently working on Backward Compatible Representation Learning, and Bilinear Class for Reinforcement Learning.

I will serve as a co-president of [Cornell University Artificial Intelligence (CUAI)](https://cuai.github.io/) from Fall 2022. We welcome Cornell undergraduates passionate about any area of machine learning.
