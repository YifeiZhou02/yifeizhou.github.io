Hi, there! I'm Yifei, a Ph.D. student at Berkeley AI Research (BAIR) advised by [prof. Sergey Levine](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/). I am interested in providing theoretical insight into various machine-learning problems so that we are confident that our algorithms can be reliable even in complicated real-world situations. I believe doing so requires a principled machine-learning approach and an understanding of how we humans tackle problems in the real world. These days, I am most interested in interactive decision-making/reinforcement learning and transferring knowledge from one problem to another.

I just graduated from Cornell as an undergrad where I have am fortunate enough to have been working with [prof. Yansong Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/ysfeng/home) at Peking University, [prof. Wen Sun](https://wensun.github.io/) at Cornell University, and [prof. Sernam Lim](https://sites.google.com/site/sernam) at Meta AI.
