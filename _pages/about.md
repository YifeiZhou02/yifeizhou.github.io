Hi, there! I'm Yifei, a second-year Ph.D. student affiliated with Berkeley AI Research (BAIR). I'm advised by [prof. Sergey Levine](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/).

These days, I am most interested in interactive decision-making/reinforcement learning with LLM/VLMs (i.e. LLM/VLM agent). In particular, I am interested in large-scale self-improvement where the agent improves itself through open-ended reinforcement learning without any human supervision. I had the pleasure of working on problems in providing theoretical insight into various machine-learning problems so that we are confident that our algorithms can be reliable even in complicated real-world situations. 

I graduated from Cornell as an undergrad where I have am fortunate enough to have been working with [prof. Yansong Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/ysfeng/home) at Peking University, [prof. Wen Sun](https://wensun.github.io/) at Cornell University, and [prof. Sernam Lim](https://sites.google.com/site/sernam) at Meta AI.
