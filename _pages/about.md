Hi, there! I'm Yifei, an undergraduate at Cornell, studying mathematics and computer science. I have been working in the area of Natural Language Processing and Theoretical Reinforcement Learning, fortunate enough to have been working with [prof. Yansong Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/ysfeng/home) at Peking University, [prof. Wen Sun](https://wensun.github.io/) at Cornell University, and [Dr. Sernam Lim](https://sites.google.com/site/sernam) at Meta AI. 

My work touches on Natural Languae Processing, Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning Theory. My research interest lies in building robust real-world machine learning agents, and doing so requires a guaranteed machine learning approach and insight from human cognition. I'm recently working on connection of online and offline RL.

I am a co-president of [Cornell University Artificial Intelligence (CUAI)](https://cuai.github.io/). We welcome Cornell undergraduates passionate about any area of machine learning.
