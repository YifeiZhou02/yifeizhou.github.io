Hi, there! I'm Yifei, a first-year Ph.D. student affiliated with Berkeley AI Research (BAIR). I had the pleasure of working on problems in providing theoretical insight into various machine-learning problems so that we are confident that our algorithms can be reliable even in complicated real-world situations. These days, I am most interested in interactive decision-making/reinforcement learning with large models and transferring knowledge from pre-training to downstream use.

I just graduated from Cornell as an undergrad where I have am fortunate enough to have been working with [prof. Yansong Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/ysfeng/home) at Peking University, [prof. Wen Sun](https://wensun.github.io/) at Cornell University, and [prof. Sernam Lim](https://sites.google.com/site/sernam) at Meta AI.
