Hi, there, and welcome! I'm Yifei, an undergraduate of class 2024 at Cornell, studying fantastic mathematics and computer science. I have been working in the area of Natural Language Processing and Theoretical Reinforcement Learning, fortunate enough to be advised by [prof. Yansong Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/ysfeng/home) at Peking University, [prof. Wen Sun](https://wensun.github.io/) at Cornell University, and [Dr. Sernam Lim](https://sites.google.com/site/sernam) at Meta AI. 

My work touches on Natural Languae Processing, Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning. My research interest lies in building principled and generalizable deep learning methods, and doing so requires a guaranteed machine learning approach and insight from human cognition. I'm recently working on Backward Compatible Representation Learning, and Imitation Learning.

I am a co-president of [Cornell University Artificial Intelligence (CUAI)](https://cuai.github.io/). If you are a Cornell Undergraduate passionate about research in any area of machine learning, please shoot me an email.
