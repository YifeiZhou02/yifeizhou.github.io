Hi, there! I'm Yifei, an undergraduate at Cornell, studying mathematics and computer science. I have been working in the area of Natural Language Processing and Theoretical Reinforcement Learning, fortunate enough to have been working with [prof. Yansong Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/ysfeng/home) at Peking University, [prof. Wen Sun](https://wensun.github.io/) at Cornell University, and [Dr. Sernam Lim](https://sites.google.com/site/sernam) at Meta AI. 

My work touches on Natural Languae Processing, Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning Theory. I am most excited about providing theoretical insight into various machine learning problems so that we are confident that our algorithms can be reliable even in complicated real-world situations. I believe doing so requires a guaranteed machine learning approach and insight from how humans perceive the world. To this end, I seek to explore the concerns of modern machine learning and how it can be improved by theoretically principled algorithms.

I am a co-president of [Cornell University Artificial Intelligence (CUAI)](https://cuai.github.io/). We welcome Cornell undergraduates passionate about any area of machine learning.

### I will be joining Berkeley AI Research (BAIR) for my Ph.D. study from Fall 2023!
